# IToL_tools
Tools for tree annotation with the Interactive Tree of Life.  

taxDBTools.py processes the NCBI taxonomic database into a parseable form.

IToL_tools.py is capable of automating the generation of range colours by taxonomic identity (using the CSV file generated by taxDBTools.py) and the generation of binary symol annotations using a separate FASTA files..ools.py)

Very much a work in progress, not recommended for use by anyone right now.
